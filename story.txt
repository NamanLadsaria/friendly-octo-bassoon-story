Long time a ago this was a world in habitited by foul creatures who dwelled on this 
earth eating everything that came on its way
 
At that time, there also were some creatures, ancestor of Human being, who have bigger
body than the Human being now. The shortest one were about 8ft tall, but they knew how
to move their bodies fast. All men and women are raised by warriors to fight the 
creatures who eat everything.

These barbaric creatures will smear toxic liquids to attack warriors who protect humans.
Once hit by these venoms, any object will immediately become rotten.

The war began at dawn. The barbaric creatures swarmed the front lines and shot there toxic liquids towards the armed warriors.
Warriors difflected as much as they could but couldnt hold off for ever.
Warriors stormed the front lines in pairs and were being eaten as fast as they were running.
Clever enough, prior to the war, committed warriors drank poison before running forward.
In the end, all creatures became deceased and the warriors prevailed to fight the next great war.

Theses warriors ruled the land for a long time as they had no compettion anymore until the great war part2
now thats a story for some other time.
